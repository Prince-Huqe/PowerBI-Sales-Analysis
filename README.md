   My journey into data began with 5+ years of experience as a Database Programmer, where I worked extensively with Seagate Crystal Reports,
developing reports and performing analysis. This foundational experience equipped me with a solid understanding of database management and reporting.

I achieved the Microsoft Certified Solution Developer (MCSD) certification, specializing in Visual Basic, SQL Server, and Software Architecture to further 
enhance my technical expertise. This certification showcases my in-depth knowledge of database systems and architecture, allowing me to develop robust
and effective solutions.

During my 2-year Advanced Diploma in Information Technology (Software Development) at NIIT-India, I worked on a large database software project as part of
my studies. Through this project, I gained experience with various types of reports and analysis.

After that, I myself, independently developed a complete 'One-point Sales' software for a BATA Shoe branch using Visual Basic, SQL/MS Access, and Crystal
Report. I created the entire software package on my own and successfully sold it to the owner. This individual project provided me with extensive real-life 
experience in reporting and analysis
  

Additionally, I enhanced my analytical skills by achieving a High Distinction (HD) with 90/100 marks in the Supply Chain Analytics unit as part of my 
Bachelor of Business degree at Victoria University, Australia. This provided me with a strong grounding in statistical analysis and supply chain
optimization.

More recently, I have gained hands-on experience with Power BI, DAX functions, and data visualization through some exciting real-life projects, including 
the one presented here.

Although I haven’t worked professionally as a Data Analyst at a company yet, but I have developed relevant skills through relevant certificate course,
studies and developing these real-life Power BI projects. These experiences have prepared me to contribute meaningfully in an entry-level Power BI role.

Moreover, I received a testimonial from my university lecturer in recognition of my excellence in Database Systems, achieving a High Distinction (HD) 
with a mark of 88/100 during my Bachelor of Business degree. This testimonial highlights my strong understanding of SQL, data normalization, and database
design, as well as my commitment to academic excellence.
